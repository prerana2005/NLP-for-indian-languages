        "# The Scenario\n",
        "You are the **Lead Data Scientist at Hombale Films**, the production house behind India's new wave of global hits. The marketing team is strategizing for the massive release of the prequel, ***Kantara: Chapter 1***.\n",
        "\n",
        "The film represents a unique cinematic experiment: it is deeply rooted in the folklore of the Karavali region of coastal Karnataka, yet it is being consumed by a massive national audience. The studio faces a unique cultural interpretation challenge: reviews on local forums in Kannada often discuss the film using deep spiritual concepts and specific cultural terminology (e.g., *Daiva Nartana*, *Bhoota Kola*), whereas reviews on pan-India portals often discuss the film using cinematic metrics such as VFX, action, and screenplay. Standard \"off-the-shelf\" NLP tools fail to process this data because they cannot handle the complex morphology of Dravidian languages or the heavy code-mixing used by fans on social media.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "# The Task\n",
        "You have been tasked with engineering a **custom NLP pipeline** to process and compare vernacular text streams in **Hindi** and **Kannada**. Your objective is to address the disparities in linguistic tool availability for these languages by developing custom tokenizers to handle complex agglutination. You will then deploy and evaluate standard models to determine how effectively they can identify domain-specific entities across disparate scripts and morphological structures.\n",
        "\n",
        "Instead of using pre-built tools for your implementation, you will engineer the core components from scratch:\n",
        "\n",
        "> ### 1. Data Ingestion & Normalization Module\n",
        "You will implement a web scraping module to extract raw text from disparate sources (news articles vs. online forums) and apply Unicode normalization to handle script-specific inconsistencies, ensuring a clean data foundation.\n",
        "\n",
        "> ### 2. Custom Tokenization Layer\n",
        "Since standard tokenizers struggle with Dravidian agglutination, you will engineer **BPE** and **WordPiece** algorithms from scratch. You will analyze N-Grams and vocabulary structures to determine which algorithm best preserves the semantic integrity of complex Kannada words compared to Hindi.\n",
        "\n",
        "> ### 3. Morphological & Semantic Analytics Layer\n",
        "You will implement a comparative study of **stemming vs. lemmatization** to demonstrate why dictionary-based approaches are critical for Indian languages. Finally, you will deploy and \"stress-test\" standard models (**POS Taggers**, **XLM-RoBERTa** for NER) to identify specific linguistic entities.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "# Final Objective\n",
        "Through this implementation, you will explicitly map the resource and research gaps, identifying exactly where standard NLP pipelines fail for low-resource languages (Kannada) and where custom engineering is the only viable solution."

            " Kantara 2 Movie Review: कभी-कभी कोई फिल्म आपको बिल्कुल निशब्द कर देती है। कभी उसका असर इतना गहरा होता है कि शब्द ही नहीं मिलते। कभी आप इतने प्रभावित होते हैं कि उसके बारे में बात करना ही बंद नहीं कर पाते। और कभी वह आपके दिल को इतना छू जाती है कि आप बस उसकी जादुई दुनिया में खो जाते हैं।\n",
            "लेकिन जब कोई फिल्म ये सब एक साथ कर दिखाती है, तो वह सिर्फ एक मास्टरपीस नहीं रह जाती वह एक सांस्कृतिक घटना बन जाती है। ऋषभ शेट्टी की ‘कांतारा: चैप्टर 1’ ठीक ऐसा ही असर छोड़ती है।\n",
            "फिल्म की शुरुआत कदंब वंश और उसके क्रूर शासक से होती है, जिसकी लालच हर ज़मीन और पानी को कब्ज़े में लेने की है। चाहे आदमी हो, औरत या बच्चा उसके लिए कोई मायने नहीं। वह सबको मारकर अपनी हुकूमत फैलाता है।\n",
            "एक बार, ऐसे ही अभियान के दौरान वह समुद्र किनारे मछली पकड़ते एक रहस्यमयी बूढ़े आदमी को देखता है। अपने सैनिकों को उसे पकड़ने का आदेश देता है। जैसे ही वे उसे खींचकर ले जाते हैं, उसके थैले से कीमती सामान गिरते हैं।\n",
            "शासक उन चीज़ों को देखता है और उनके स्रोत की खोज में निकल पड़ता है। यह सफ़र उसे कांतारा तक ले जाता है, जहां जनजातियां प्रकृति के साथ सामंजस्य में रहती हैं। जब उसकी नज़र ईश्वर पूंधोट्टम पर पड़ती है जो कांतारा की एक पवित्र जगह है और दिव्य शक्ति द्वारा संरक्षित है तभी उसकी महत्वाकांक्षा को असली चुनौती मिलती है।\n",
            "कई सालों बाद कहानी पहुंचती है विजयेंद्र (जयाराम) तक, जो भांगड़ा का राजा है। लंबे शासन के बाद उसका बेटा कुलशेखर (गुलशन देवैया) राजा बनता है, और उसकी बेटी कनकवती (रुक्मिणी वसंत) कोष की ज़िम्मेदारी संभालती है।\n",
            "दूसरी तरफ, कांतारा के नेता बर्मे (ऋषभ शेट्टी) गांव को विकसित करने और लोगों का जीवन सुधारने की कोशिश करते हैं। जब कांतारा के लोग भांगड़ा पहुंचते हैं, तो मामला ज़मीन के मालिकाना हक, उसकी रक्षा और उसके विनाश की धमकी पर बड़ा संघर्ष बन जाता है।\n",
            "अगर 2022 की ‘कांतारा’ ने आपकी सांसें रोक दी थीं, तो यह प्रीक्वल (पहला भाग) उस अनुभव को दस गुना बढ़ा देता है। फिल्म जैसे ही कदंब और भांगड़ा वंश और जनजातियों की पृष्ठभूमि वाली आवाज़ से शुरू होती है, आप उसकी दुनिया में खो जाते हैं।\n",
            "हर दृश्य बेहद बारीकी से गढ़ा गया है। दमन, समानता और शोषण इन सबको फिल्म गहरी संवेदनशीलता से छूती है। जैसे रथ और घोड़े वाला दृश्य, जहां कांतारा की जनजाति जिन्हें अछूत माना जाता है उन्हें चलाते हैं। यह दृश्य इतना सहज और दमदार है कि नज़र हटाना मुश्किल हो जाता है।\n",
            "फिल्म का पहला हिस्सा बेहद दमदार है। चाहे रथ और घोड़े का पीछा करने वाला सीन हो या इंटरवल से पहले जंगल की लड़ाई फिल्मनिर्माण अपने शिखर पर दिखता है। ऋषभ शेट्टी ने जिस जुनून और मेहनत से इसे बनाया है, वह हर फ्रेम में झलकता है।\n",
            "जब कहानी भांगड़ा राज्य और शराबी कुलशेखर पर आती है, तो एक और जनजाति का जिक्र होता है और कहानी और गहरी हो जाती है। यह सिर्फ अमीर बनाम गरीब की लड़ाई नहीं है, बल्कि जनजातियों के भीतर भी सत्ता संघर्ष और अच्छाई-बुराई की जंग सामने आती है। ‘कांतारा’ की डरावनी गुलिगा चीख यहां और भी प्रभावी हो जाती है। ऋषभ शेट्टी का बर्मे अलग-अलग तरह की चीखों से भावनाएँ प्रकट करता है। ये दृश्य लगातार रोंगटे खड़े कर देने वाले हैं।\n",
            "अगर ऋषभ शेट्टी इस फिल्म का स्तंभ हैं, तो रुक्मिणी वसंत (कनकवती) मजबूत सहारा हैं। उनका किरदार बहुत दमदार है और उन्होंने शानदार अभिनय किया है। जयाराम अपनी अनुभवी अदाकारी से फिल्म को और गहराई देते हैं। गुलशन देवैया का अयोग्य राजा वाला रोल इतना सही बैठता है कि उनकी मौजूदगी ही खलती है और यही उनकी सफलता है।\n",
            "‘कांतारा: चैप्टर 1’ की सबसे बड़ी ताकत उसकी परतदार और प्रतीकात्मक कहानी है। यह सोचने पर मजबूर करती है, और जब कोई फिल्म ऐसा करती है तो वह दर्शकों को पूरी तरह बांध लेती है। कहानी और अभिनय के अलावा फिल्म तकनीकी स्तर पर भी बेहतरीन है। अरविंद एस कश्यप की सिनेमैटोग्राफी, अजनिश लोकनाथ का संगीत और विज़ुअल इफेक्ट्स शानदार हैं।\n",
            "‘कांतारा’ की तुलना में प्रीक्वल में और भी बड़े सिनेमाई दृश्य हैं, लेकिन यह कहानी पर हावी नहीं होते। हालांकि, दूसरे हिस्से में कुछ ग्राफिक्स थोड़े कमजोर लगते हैं, पर यह छोटी सी कमी है। फिल्म का क्लाइमैक्स और गुलिगा वाले दृश्य बार-बार देखने लायक हैं। ऋषभ शेट्टी इन पलों में वाकई प्रकृति की ताकत जैसे लगते हैं। इतने प्रभावशाली दृश्य और इतनी गहरी कहानी के साथ, ‘कांतारा’ की इस दुनिया से प्यार होना स्वाभाविक है। इसी वजह से ‘कांतारा: चैप्टर 1’ इस साल की बेहतरीन फिल्मों में गिनी जाएगी।\n",

            "ऋषभ शेट्टी की ‘कांतारा चैप्टर 1’ की शुरुआत उस वादे से होती है जो उन्होंने थिएटर के बाहर ही जनता से किया है. उनकी 2022 में आई फिल्म ‘कांतारा’ ने दंतकथा पर बेस्ड ऐसा संसार रचा था, ऐसी कहानी दिखाई थी जो जनता ने पहले कभी नहीं देखी थी. सिनेमा के पर्दे पर नया संसार रचने में ये फिल्म खुद में आइकॉनिक बन चुकी है. \n",
            "ऐसे में ऋषभ के सामने चैलेंज ये था कि उन्हें ‘कांतारा चैप्टर 1’ में ना सिर्फ पिछला लेवल बरकरार रखना है, बल्कि उससे और एक कदम आगे जाना है. क्या ऋषभ कामयाब हुए? इसके जवाब के लिए हम फिल्म देख रहे हैं, और साथ-साथ आपको दे रहे हैं ये रिव्यू…\n",
            "कहां से शुरू होती है कहानी? \n",
            "‘कांतारा चैप्टर 1’ उस रहस्य से शुरू होती है, जो पहली फिल्म में अधूरा छूटा था― शिवा, उसके पिता, और उनसे पिछली पीढ़ियों में भूत-कोला करने वाले जंगल में उस एक अंधेरी जगह पर ही क्यों गायब होते हैं? इस रहस्य का जवाब उस दंतकथा में है, जो पिछली फिल्म में केवल छुई गई थी. अब आप इस कथा में गहरे उतरते हैं.\n",
            "कहानी आपको एक जंगल और राजा के शासन में ले जाती है. इस हिस्से में पहले राजा और जंगल में एक दीवार खड़ी होती है. मगर आने वाली पीढ़ियों में उस दीवार के पार देखने की जिज्ञासा कहानी को आगे बढ़ाती है.\n",
            "फर्स्ट हाफ की शुरुआत में आपको कहानी नैरेट की जा रही है, बैकग्राउंड समझाया जा रहा है. इस सेटअप में समय लगता है. शायद आप कुछ जगहों पर सब्र छोड़ने वाले हों, लेकिन तभी ऋषभ अपने नए संसार के पत्ते खोलते हैं. वो जंगल के समुदाय के लीडर हैं, नाम है बेरमे. जंगल का ये संसार जिस तरह रचा गया है, उसमें इतनी डिटेल है कि उसे देखते हुए आप ऋषभ की स्टोरीटेलिंग के कायल होते चले जाते हैं.\n",
            "राजकुमारी कनकवती की एंट्री होती है. किरदार निभा रहीं रुक्मिणी वसंत पहले फ्रेम से अटेंशन बांध लेती हैं. बेरमे और कनकवती की केमिस्ट्री, सबसे बेहतरीन लव स्टोरीज को टक्कर देती है. फिर आता है कहानी का कनफ्लिक्ट. जो इंटरवल ब्लॉक में समेटा गया है. जहां शुरुआत में आप फिल्म के थोड़ा ज्यादा ‘बोलने’ से सब्र खोने वाले थे, वहीं इस ब्लॉक में एक शब्द नहीं बोला गया है. सबकुछ स्क्रीन पर घट रहा है. विजुअल्स में इमोशन है, भाव हैं और प्रतीक हैं. \n",
            "टेक्निकली, विजुअल्स के लेवल पर, स्टोरीटेलिंग में, एक नया संसार गढ़ने में ऋषभ की मास्टरी दिख रही है. ‘कांतारा चैप्टर 1’ का माहौल सेट है, विजुअल एक्सपीरिएंस अद्भुत है. एक्शन शानदार है. वर्ल्ड-बिल्डिंग, रोमांस आपको अरेस्ट करने वाला है. अब देखना है कि सेकंड हाफ में क्या जादू होता है.\n",
            "‘कांतारा चैप्टर 1’ का सेकंड हाफ इसकी जान है. फर्स्ट हाफ खत्म होते-होते फिल्म जहां तक पहुंची थी, वो जैसे एक दरवाजा था जो आगे के लिए खोला गया था. सेकंड हाफ शुरू होते ही आप जहां कदम रखते हैं, वहां पूरी फिल्म का रहस्य है. जंगल के मिथक यहां खुल रहे हैं. माइथोलॉजिकल शक्तियां अब अपने खेल के चरम पर हैं. \n",
            "अब कहानी जो ट्विस्ट लेती है, उसकी कल्पना भी आप पहले से नहीं कर पाते. फिल्म की राइटिंग टीम को सलाम बनता है. इस विजुअली अद्भुत संसार, जादुई म्यूजिक स्कोर और सिनेमाई तकनीक के साथ उन्होंने जो ट्विस्ट कहानी को दिया है, वो किसी बेहतरीन थ्रिलर जैसा है. \n",
            "धमाकेदार है क्लाइमेक्स\n",
            "सेकंड हाफ जिस हाई नोट पर, उमड़ते-घुमड़ते इमोशंस वाले मोड़ से शुरू हुआ, उसमें मुझे ये चिंता थी कि कहीं क्लाइमेक्स की तरफ फिल्म की एनर्जी डाउन ना होने लगे. मगर ऋषभ ने पूरे सेकंड हाफ में एनर्जी को जहां पहुंचाया है वो इंडियन सिनेमा में याद रखा जाएगा. \n",
            "क्लाइमेक्स के महत्वपूर्ण सीक्वेंस में ‘कांतारा चैप्टर 1’ माइथोलॉजी की जिस साइड है, वहां ऋषभ को एक जगह पूरी तरह ग्राफिक्स से तैयार एक कैरेक्टर पर जाना पड़ा. इससे उस सीक्वेंस का फील अभी तक रियल नजर आ रहे विजुअल्स से अलग तो होता है. मगर ये पूरी तरह ऋषभ की कहानी का विजुअल व्याकरण है जो तब भी आपको कहानी में बांधे रखता है. \n",
            "क्लाइमेक्स फिल्म को उससे भी हाई नोट पर ले जाता है, जहां से सेकंड हाफ शुरू हुआ था. ‘कांतारा चैप्टर 1’ एक और फ़िल्म के वादे के साथ खत्म होती है. मगर ऋषभ का रचा संसार, उनकी फिल्ममेकिंग और उनका शानदार काम आपके साथ रहता है. क्लाइमेक्स की तरफ ये फिल्म एक जगह सिनेमा से ऊपर उठ जाती है और कुछ ऐसा महसूस करवाती है, जो कहा नहीं जा सकता. \n",
            "फिल्म की लीड एक्ट्रेस रुक्मिणी वसंत पर नजर रखिएगा, आपको कोई आईडिया नहीं है वो इस कहानी में आगे क्या करने वाली हैं. युद्ध के सीन, हिस्टोरिकल वॉर ड्रामाज को टक्कर देते हैं. एक्शन कोरियोग्राफी फिल्म का हाई पॉइंट है. ‘कांतारा चैप्टर 1’ देखते हुए अपने देश की संस्कृति पर भी आपको एक गर्व महसूस हो सकता है. और गर्व होता है ऋषभ को कि इसे उन्होंने अपने सिनेमेटिक अंदाज में इतना शानदार अनुभव बनाया है. ये ऐसी फिल्म बन गई है जिसे जितनी बार देखा जाएगा, कुछ अलग, कुछ नया महसूस होगा.\n",

            " कभीकभी कोई फिल्म आपको बिल्कुल निशब्द कर देती है। कभी उसका असर इतना गहरा होता है कि शब्द ही नहीं मिलते। कभी आप इतने प्रभावित होते हैं कि उसके बारे में बात करना ही बंद नहीं कर पाते। और कभी वह आपके दिल को इतना छू जाती है कि आप बस उसकी जादुई दुनिया में खो जाते हैं।\n",
            "लेकिन जब कोई फिल्म ये सब एक साथ कर दिखाती है तो वह सिर्फ एक मास्टरपीस नहीं रह जाती वह एक सांस्कृतिक घटना बन जाती है। ऋषभ शेट्टी की कांतारा चैप्टर ठीक ऐसा ही असर छोड़ती है।\n",
            "फिल्म की शुरुआत कदंब वंश और उसके क्रूर शासक से होती है जिसकी लालच हर ज़मीन और पानी को कब्ज़े में लेने की है। चाहे आदमी हो औरत या बच्चा उसके लिए कोई मायने नहीं। वह सबको मारकर अपनी हुकूमत फैलाता है।\n",
            "एक बार ऐसे ही अभियान के दौरान वह समुद्र किनारे मछली पकड़ते एक रहस्यमयी बूढ़े आदमी को देखता है। अपने सैनिकों को उसे पकड़ने का आदेश देता है। जैसे ही वे उसे खींचकर ले जाते हैं उसके थैले से कीमती सामान गिरते हैं।\n",
            "शासक उन चीज़ों को देखता है और उनके स्रोत की खोज में निकल पड़ता है। यह सफ़र उसे कांतारा तक ले जाता है जहां जनजातियां प्रकृति के साथ सामंजस्य में रहती हैं। जब उसकी नज़र ईश्वर पूंधोट्टम पर पड़ती है जो कांतारा की एक पवित्र जगह है और दिव्य शक्ति द्वारा संरक्षित है तभी उसकी महत्वाकांक्षा को असली चुनौती मिलती है।\n",
            "कई सालों बाद कहानी पहुंचती है विजयेंद्र जयाराम तक जो भांगड़ा का राजा है। लंबे शासन के बाद उसका बेटा कुलशेखर गुलशन देवैया राजा बनता है और उसकी बेटी कनकवती रुक्मिणी वसंत कोष की ज़िम्मेदारी संभालती है।\n",
            "दूसरी तरफ कांतारा के नेता बर्मे ऋषभ शेट्टी गांव को विकसित करने और लोगों का जीवन सुधारने की कोशिश करते हैं। जब कांतारा के लोग भांगड़ा पहुंचते हैं तो मामला ज़मीन के मालिकाना हक उसकी रक्षा और उसके विनाश की धमकी पर बड़ा संघर्ष बन जाता है।\n",
            "अगर की कांतारा ने आपकी सांसें रोक दी थीं तो यह प्रीक्वल पहला भाग उस अनुभव को दस गुना बढ़ा देता है। फिल्म जैसे ही कदंब और भांगड़ा वंश और जनजातियों की पृष्ठभूमि वाली आवाज़ से शुरू होती है आप उसकी दुनिया में खो जाते हैं।\n",
            "हर दृश्य बेहद बारीकी से गढ़ा गया है। दमन समानता और शोषण इन सबको फिल्म गहरी संवेदनशीलता से छूती है। जैसे रथ और घोड़े वाला दृश्य जहां कांतारा की जनजाति जिन्हें अछूत माना जाता है उन्हें चलाते हैं। यह दृश्य इतना सहज और दमदार है कि नज़र हटाना मुश्किल हो जाता है।\n",
            "फिल्म का पहला हिस्सा बेहद दमदार है। चाहे रथ और घोड़े का पीछा करने वाला सीन हो या इंटरवल से पहले जंगल की लड़ाई फिल्मनिर्माण अपने शिखर पर दिखता है। ऋषभ शेट्टी ने जिस जुनून और मेहनत से इसे बनाया है वह हर फ्रेम में झलकता है।\n",
            "जब कहानी भांगड़ा राज्य और शराबी कुलशेखर पर आती है तो एक और जनजाति का जिक्र होता है और कहानी और गहरी हो जाती है। यह सिर्फ अमीर बनाम गरीब की लड़ाई नहीं है बल्कि जनजातियों के भीतर भी सत्ता संघर्ष और अच्छाईबुराई की जंग सामने आती है। कांतारा की डरावनी गुलिगा चीख यहां और भी प्रभावी हो जाती है। ऋषभ शेट्टी का बर्मे अलगअलग तरह की चीखों से भावनाएँ प्रकट करता है। ये दृश्य लगातार रोंगटे खड़े कर देने वाले हैं।\n",
            "अगर ऋषभ शेट्टी इस फिल्म का स्तंभ हैं तो रुक्मिणी वसंत कनकवती मजबूत सहारा हैं। उनका किरदार बहुत दमदार है और उन्होंने शानदार अभिनय किया है। जयाराम अपनी अनुभवी अदाकारी से फिल्म को और गहराई देते हैं। गुलशन देवैया का अयोग्य राजा वाला रोल इतना सही बैठता है कि उनकी मौजूदगी ही खलती है और यही उनकी सफलता है।\n",
            "कांतारा चैप्टर की सबसे बड़ी ताकत उसकी परतदार और प्रतीकात्मक कहानी है। यह सोचने पर मजबूर करती है और जब कोई फिल्म ऐसा करती है तो वह दर्शकों को पूरी तरह बांध लेती है। कहानी और अभिनय के अलावा फिल्म तकनीकी स्तर पर भी बेहतरीन है। अरविंद एस कश्यप की सिनेमैटोग्राफी अजनिश लोकनाथ का संगीत और विज़ुअल इफेक्ट्स शानदार हैं।\n",
            "कांतारा की तुलना में प्रीक्वल में और भी बड़े सिनेमाई दृश्य हैं लेकिन यह कहानी पर हावी नहीं होते। हालांकि दूसरे हिस्से में कुछ ग्राफिक्स थोड़े कमजोर लगते हैं पर यह छोटी सी कमी है। फिल्म का क्लाइमैक्स और गुलिगा वाले दृश्य बारबार देखने लायक हैं। ऋषभ शेट्टी इन पलों में वाकई प्रकृति की ताकत जैसे लगते हैं। इतने प्रभावशाली दृश्य और इतनी गहरी कहानी के साथ कांतारा की इस दुनिया से प्यार होना स्वाभाविक है। इसी वजह से कांतारा चैप्टर इस साल की बेहतरीन फिल्मों में गिनी जाएगी।\n",
            "ऋषभ शेट्टी की कांतारा चैप्टर की शुरुआत उस वादे से होती है जो उन्होंने थिएटर के बाहर ही जनता से किया है उनकी में आई फिल्म कांतारा ने दंतकथा पर बेस्ड ऐसा संसार रचा था ऐसी कहानी दिखाई थी जो जनता ने पहले कभी नहीं देखी थी सिनेमा के पर्दे पर नया संसार रचने में ये फिल्म खुद में आइकॉनिक बन चुकी है\n",
            "ऐसे में ऋषभ के सामने चैलेंज ये था कि उन्हें कांतारा चैप्टर में ना सिर्फ पिछला लेवल बरकरार रखना है बल्कि उससे और एक कदम आगे जाना है क्या ऋषभ कामयाब हुए इसके जवाब के लिए हम फिल्म देख रहे हैं और साथसाथ आपको दे रहे हैं ये रिव्यू\n",
            "कहां से शुरू होती है कहानी\n",
            "कांतारा चैप्टर उस रहस्य से शुरू होती है जो पहली फिल्म में अधूरा छूटा था शिवा उसके पिता और उनसे पिछली पीढ़ियों में भूतकोला करने वाले जंगल में उस एक अंधेरी जगह पर ही क्यों गायब होते हैं इस रहस्य का जवाब उस दंतकथा में है जो पिछली फिल्म में केवल छुई गई थी अब आप इस कथा में गहरे उतरते हैं\n",
            "कहानी आपको एक जंगल और राजा के शासन में ले जाती है इस हिस्से में पहले राजा और जंगल में एक दीवार खड़ी होती है मगर आने वाली पीढ़ियों में उस दीवार के पार देखने की जिज्ञासा कहानी को आगे बढ़ाती है\n",
            "फर्स्ट हाफ की शुरुआत में आपको कहानी नैरेट की जा रही है बैकग्राउंड समझाया जा रहा है इस सेटअप में समय लगता है शायद आप कुछ जगहों पर सब्र छोड़ने वाले हों लेकिन तभी ऋषभ अपने नए संसार के पत्ते खोलते हैं वो जंगल के समुदाय के लीडर हैं नाम है बेरमे जंगल का ये संसार जिस तरह रचा गया है उसमें इतनी डिटेल है कि उसे देखते हुए आप ऋषभ की स्टोरीटेलिंग के कायल होते चले जाते हैं\n",
            "राजकुमारी कनकवती की एंट्री होती है किरदार निभा रहीं रुक्मिणी वसंत पहले फ्रेम से अटेंशन बांध लेती हैं बेरमे और कनकवती की केमिस्ट्री सबसे बेहतरीन लव स्टोरीज को टक्कर देती है फिर आता है कहानी का कनफ्लिक्ट जो इंटरवल ब्लॉक में समेटा गया है जहां शुरुआत में आप फिल्म के थोड़ा ज्यादा बोलने से सब्र खोने वाले थे वहीं इस ब्लॉक में एक शब्द नहीं बोला गया है सबकुछ स्क्रीन पर घट रहा है विजुअल्स में इमोशन है भाव हैं और प्रतीक हैं\n",
            "टेक्निकली विजुअल्स के लेवल पर स्टोरीटेलिंग में एक नया संसार गढ़ने में ऋषभ की मास्टरी दिख रही है कांतारा चैप्टर का माहौल सेट है विजुअल एक्सपीरिएंस अद्भुत है एक्शन शानदार है वर्ल्डबिल्डिंग रोमांस आपको अरेस्ट करने वाला है अब देखना है कि सेकंड हाफ में क्या जादू होता है\n",
            "कांतारा चैप्टर का सेकंड हाफ इसकी जान है फर्स्ट हाफ खत्म होतेहोते फिल्म जहां तक पहुंची थी वो जैसे एक दरवाजा था जो आगे के लिए खोला गया था सेकंड हाफ शुरू होते ही आप जहां कदम रखते हैं वहां पूरी फिल्म का रहस्य है जंगल के मिथक यहां खुल रहे हैं माइथोलॉजिकल शक्तियां अब अपने खेल के चरम पर हैं\n",
            "अब कहानी जो ट्विस्ट लेती है उसकी कल्पना भी आप पहले से नहीं कर पाते फिल्म की राइटिंग टीम को सलाम बनता है इस विजुअली अद्भुत संसार जादुई म्यूजिक स्कोर और सिनेमाई तकनीक के साथ उन्होंने जो ट्विस्ट कहानी को दिया है वो किसी बेहतरीन थ्रिलर जैसा है\n",
            "धमाकेदार है क्लाइमेक्स\n",
            "सेकंड हाफ जिस हाई नोट पर उमड़तेघुमड़ते इमोशंस वाले मोड़ से शुरू हुआ उसमें मुझे ये चिंता थी कि कहीं क्लाइमेक्स की तरफ फिल्म की एनर्जी डाउन ना होने लगे मगर ऋषभ ने पूरे सेकंड हाफ में एनर्जी को जहां पहुंचाया है वो इंडियन सिनेमा में याद रखा जाएगा\n",
            "क्लाइमेक्स के महत्वपूर्ण सीक्वेंस में कांतारा चैप्टर माइथोलॉजी की जिस साइड है वहां ऋषभ को एक जगह पूरी तरह ग्राफिक्स से तैयार एक कैरेक्टर पर जाना पड़ा इससे उस सीक्वेंस का फील अभी तक रियल नजर आ रहे विजुअल्स से अलग तो होता है मगर ये पूरी तरह ऋषभ की कहानी का विजुअल व्याकरण है जो तब भी आपको कहानी में बांधे रखता है\n",
            "क्लाइमेक्स फिल्म को उससे भी हाई नोट पर ले जाता है जहां से सेकंड हाफ शुरू हुआ था कांतारा चैप्टर एक और फ़िल्म के वादे के साथ खत्म होती है मगर ऋषभ का रचा संसार उनकी फिल्ममेकिंग और उनका शानदार काम आपके साथ रहता है क्लाइमेक्स की तरफ ये फिल्म एक जगह सिनेमा से ऊपर उठ जाती है और कुछ ऐसा महसूस करवाती है जो कहा नहीं जा सकता\n",

            " कभीकभी कोई फिल्म आपको बिल्कुल निशब्द कर देती है। कभी उसका असर इतना गहरा होता है कि शब्द ही नहीं मिलते। कभी आप इतने प्रभावित होते हैं कि उसके बारे में बात करना ही बंद नहीं कर पाते। और कभी वह आपके दिल को इतना छू जाती है कि आप बस उसकी जादुई दुनिया में खो जाते हैं।\n",
            "लेकिन जब कोई फिल्म ये सब एक साथ कर दिखाती है तो वह सिर्फ एक मास्टरपीस नहीं रह जाती वह एक सांस्कृतिक घटना बन जाती है। ऋषभ शेट्टी की कांतारा चैप्टर ठीक ऐसा ही असर छोड़ती है।\n",
            "फिल्म की शुरुआत कदंब वंश और उसके क्रूर शासक से होती है जिसकी लालच हर ज़मीन और पानी को कब्ज़े में लेने की है। चाहे आदमी हो औरत या बच्चा उसके लिए कोई मायने नहीं। वह सबको मारकर अपनी हुकूमत फैलाता है।\n",
            "एक बार ऐसे ही अभियान के दौरान वह समुद्र किनारे मछली पकड़ते एक रहस्यमयी बूढ़े आदमी को देखता है। अपने सैनिकों को उसे पकड़ने का आदेश देता है। जैसे ही वे उसे खींचकर ले जाते हैं उसके थैले से कीमती सामान गिरते हैं।\n",
            "शासक उन चीज़ों को देखता है और उनके स्रोत की खोज में निकल पड़ता है। यह सफ़र उसे कांतारा तक ले जाता है जहां जनजातियां प्रकृति के साथ सामंजस्य में रहती हैं। जब उसकी नज़र ईश्वर पूंधोट्टम पर पड़ती है जो कांतारा की एक पवित्र जगह है और दिव्य शक्ति द्वारा संरक्षित है तभी उसकी महत्वाकांक्षा को असली चुनौती मिलती है।\n",
            "कई सालों बाद कहानी पहुंचती है विजयेंद्र जयाराम तक जो भांगड़ा का राजा है। लंबे शासन के बाद उसका बेटा कुलशेखर गुलशन देवैया राजा बनता है और उसकी बेटी कनकवती रुक्मिणी वसंत कोष की ज़िम्मेदारी संभालती है।\n",
            "दूसरी तरफ कांतारा के नेता बर्मे ऋषभ शेट्टी गांव को विकसित करने और लोगों का जीवन सुधारने की कोशिश करते हैं। जब कांतारा के लोग भांगड़ा पहुंचते हैं तो मामला ज़मीन के मालिकाना हक उसकी रक्षा और उसके विनाश की धमकी पर बड़ा संघर्ष बन जाता है।\n",
            "अगर की कांतारा ने आपकी सांसें रोक दी थीं तो यह प्रीक्वल पहला भाग उस अनुभव को दस गुना बढ़ा देता है। फिल्म जैसे ही कदंब और भांगड़ा वंश और जनजातियों की पृष्ठभूमि वाली आवाज़ से शुरू होती है आप उसकी दुनिया में खो जाते हैं।\n",
            "हर दृश्य बेहद बारीकी से गढ़ा गया है। दमन समानता और शोषण इन सबको फिल्म गहरी संवेदनशीलता से छूती है। जैसे रथ और घोड़े वाला दृश्य जहां कांतारा की जनजाति जिन्हें अछूत माना जाता है उन्हें चलाते हैं। यह दृश्य इतना सहज और दमदार है कि नज़र हटाना मुश्किल हो जाता है।\n",
            "फिल्म का पहला हिस्सा बेहद दमदार है। चाहे रथ और घोड़े का पीछा करने वाला सीन हो या इंटरवल से पहले जंगल की लड़ाई फिल्मनिर्माण अपने शिखर पर दिखता है। ऋषभ शेट्टी ने जिस जुनून और मेहनत से इसे बनाया है वह हर फ्रेम में झलकता है।\n",
            "जब कहानी भांगड़ा राज्य और शराबी कुलशेखर पर आती है तो एक और जनजाति का जिक्र होता है और कहानी और गहरी हो जाती है। यह सिर्फ अमीर बनाम गरीब की लड़ाई नहीं है बल्कि जनजातियों के भीतर भी सत्ता संघर्ष और अच्छाईबुराई की जंग सामने आती है। कांतारा की डरावनी गुलिगा चीख यहां और भी प्रभावी हो जाती है। ऋषभ शेट्टी का बर्मे अलगअलग तरह की चीखों से भावनाएँ प्रकट करता है। ये दृश्य लगातार रोंगटे खड़े कर देने वाले हैं।\n",
            "अगर ऋषभ शेट्टी इस फिल्म का स्तंभ हैं तो रुक्मिणी वसंत कनकवती मजबूत सहारा हैं। उनका किरदार बहुत दमदार है और उन्होंने शानदार अभिनय किया है। जयाराम अपनी अनुभवी अदाकारी से फिल्म को और गहराई देते हैं। गुलशन देवैया का अयोग्य राजा वाला रोल इतना सही बैठता है कि उनकी मौजूदगी ही खलती है और यही उनकी सफलता है।\n",
            "कांतारा चैप्टर की सबसे बड़ी ताकत उसकी परतदार और प्रतीकात्मक कहानी है। यह सोचने पर मजबूर करती है और जब कोई फिल्म ऐसा करती है तो वह दर्शकों को पूरी तरह बांध लेती है। कहानी और अभिनय के अलावा फिल्म तकनीकी स्तर पर भी बेहतरीन है। अरविंद एस कश्यप की सिनेमैटोग्राफी अजनिश लोकनाथ का संगीत और विज़ुअल इफेक्ट्स शानदार हैं।\n",
            "कांतारा की तुलना में प्रीक्वल में और भी बड़े सिनेमाई दृश्य हैं लेकिन यह कहानी पर हावी नहीं होते। हालांकि दूसरे हिस्से में कुछ ग्राफिक्स थोड़े कमजोर लगते हैं पर यह छोटी सी कमी है। फिल्म का क्लाइमैक्स और गुलिगा वाले दृश्य बारबार देखने लायक हैं। ऋषभ शेट्टी इन पलों में वाकई प्रकृति की ताकत जैसे लगते हैं। इतने प्रभावशाली दृश्य और इतनी गहरी कहानी के साथ कांतारा की इस दुनिया से प्यार होना स्वाभाविक है। इसी वजह से कांतारा चैप्टर इस साल की बेहतरीन फिल्मों में गिनी जाएगी।\n",
            "ऋषभ शेट्टी की कांतारा चैप्टर की शुरुआत उस वादे से होती है जो उन्होंने थिएटर के बाहर ही जनता से किया है उनकी में आई फिल्म कांतारा ने दंतकथा पर बेस्ड ऐसा संसार रचा था ऐसी कहानी दिखाई थी जो जनता ने पहले कभी नहीं देखी थी सिनेमा के पर्दे पर नया संसार रचने में ये फिल्म खुद में आइकॉनिक बन चुकी है\n",
            "ऐसे में ऋषभ के सामने चैलेंज ये था कि उन्हें कांतारा चैप्टर में ना सिर्फ पिछला लेवल बरकरार रखना है बल्कि उससे और एक कदम आगे जाना है क्या ऋषभ कामयाब हुए इसके जवाब के लिए हम फिल्म देख रहे हैं और साथसाथ आपको दे रहे हैं ये रिव्यू\n",
            "कहां से शुरू होती है कहानी\n",
            "कांतारा चैप्टर उस रहस्य से शुरू होती है जो पहली फिल्म में अधूरा छूटा था शिवा उसके पिता और उनसे पिछली पीढ़ियों में भूतकोला करने वाले जंगल में उस एक अंधेरी जगह पर ही क्यों गायब होते हैं इस रहस्य का जवाब उस दंतकथा में है जो पिछली फिल्म में केवल छुई गई थी अब आप इस कथा में गहरे उतरते हैं\n",
            "कहानी आपको एक जंगल और राजा के शासन में ले जाती है इस हिस्से में पहले राजा और जंगल में एक दीवार खड़ी होती है मगर आने वाली पीढ़ियों में उस दीवार के पार देखने की जिज्ञासा कहानी को आगे बढ़ाती है\n",
            "फर्स्ट हाफ की शुरुआत में आपको कहानी नैरेट की जा रही है बैकग्राउंड समझाया जा रहा है इस सेटअप में समय लगता है शायद आप कुछ जगहों पर सब्र छोड़ने वाले हों लेकिन तभी ऋषभ अपने नए संसार के पत्ते खोलते हैं वो जंगल के समुदाय के लीडर हैं नाम है बेरमे जंगल का ये संसार जिस तरह रचा गया है उसमें इतनी डिटेल है कि उसे देखते हुए आप ऋषभ की स्टोरीटेलिंग के कायल होते चले जाते हैं\n",
            "राजकुमारी कनकवती की एंट्री होती है किरदार निभा रहीं रुक्मिणी वसंत पहले फ्रेम से अटेंशन बांध लेती हैं बेरमे और कनकवती की केमिस्ट्री सबसे बेहतरीन लव स्टोरीज को टक्कर देती है फिर आता है कहानी का कनफ्लिक्ट जो इंटरवल ब्लॉक में समेटा गया है जहां शुरुआत में आप फिल्म के थोड़ा ज्यादा बोलने से सब्र खोने वाले थे वहीं इस ब्लॉक में एक शब्द नहीं बोला गया है सबकुछ स्क्रीन पर घट रहा है विजुअल्स में इमोशन है भाव हैं और प्रतीक हैं\n",
            "टेक्निकली विजुअल्स के लेवल पर स्टोरीटेलिंग में एक नया संसार गढ़ने में ऋषभ की मास्टरी दिख रही है कांतारा चैप्टर का माहौल सेट है विजुअल एक्सपीरिएंस अद्भुत है एक्शन शानदार है वर्ल्डबिल्डिंग रोमांस आपको अरेस्ट करने वाला है अब देखना है कि सेकंड हाफ में क्या जादू होता है\n",
            "कांतारा चैप्टर का सेकंड हाफ इसकी जान है फर्स्ट हाफ खत्म होतेहोते फिल्म जहां तक पहुंची थी वो जैसे एक दरवाजा था जो आगे के लिए खोला गया था सेकंड हाफ शुरू होते ही आप जहां कदम रखते हैं वहां पूरी फिल्म का रहस्य है जंगल के मिथक यहां खुल रहे हैं माइथोलॉजिकल शक्तियां अब अपने खेल के चरम पर हैं\n",
            "अब कहानी जो ट्विस्ट लेती है उसकी कल्पना भी आप पहले से नहीं कर पाते फिल्म की राइटिंग टीम को सलाम बनता है इस विजुअली अद्भुत संसार जादुई म्यूजिक स्कोर और सिनेमाई तकनीक के साथ उन्होंने जो ट्विस्ट कहानी को दिया है वो किसी बेहतरीन थ्रिलर जैसा है\n",
            "धमाकेदार है क्लाइमेक्स\n",
            "सेकंड हाफ जिस हाई नोट पर उमड़तेघुमड़ते इमोशंस वाले मोड़ से शुरू हुआ उसमें मुझे ये चिंता थी कि कहीं क्लाइमेक्स की तरफ फिल्म की एनर्जी डाउन ना होने लगे मगर ऋषभ ने पूरे सेकंड हाफ में एनर्जी को जहां पहुंचाया है वो इंडियन सिनेमा में याद रखा जाएगा\n",
            "क्लाइमेक्स के महत्वपूर्ण सीक्वेंस में कांतारा चैप्टर माइथोलॉजी की जिस साइड है वहां ऋषभ को एक जगह पूरी तरह ग्राफिक्स से तैयार एक कैरेक्टर पर जाना पड़ा इससे उस सीक्वेंस का फील अभी तक रियल नजर आ रहे विजुअल्स से अलग तो होता है मगर ये पूरी तरह ऋषभ की कहानी का विजुअल व्याकरण है जो तब भी आपको कहानी में बांधे रखता है\n",
            "क्लाइमेक्स फिल्म को उससे भी हाई नोट पर ले जाता है जहां से सेकंड हाफ शुरू हुआ था कांतारा चैप्टर एक और फ़िल्म के वादे के साथ खत्म होती है मगर ऋषभ का रचा संसार उनकी फिल्ममेकिंग और उनका शानदार काम आपके साथ रहता है क्लाइमेक्स की तरफ ये फिल्म एक जगह सिनेमा से ऊपर उठ जाती है और कुछ ऐसा महसूस करवाती है जो कहा नहीं जा सकता\n",
            "फिल्म की लीड एक्ट्रेस रुक्मिणी वसंत पर नजर रखिएगा आपको कोई आईडिया नहीं है वो इस कहानी में आगे क्या करने वाली हैं युद्ध के सीन हिस्टोरिकल वॉर ड्रामाज को टक्कर देते हैं एक्शन कोरियोग्राफी फिल्म का हाई पॉइंट है कांतारा चैप्टर देखते हुए अपने देश की संस्कृति पर भी आपको एक गर्व महसूस हो सकता है और गर्व होता है ऋषभ को कि इसे उन्होंने अपने सिनेमेटिक अंदाज में इतना शानदार अनुभव बनाया है ये ऐसी फिल्म बन गई है जिसे जितनी बार देखा जाएगा कुछ अलग कुछ नया महसूस होगा\n",
            "बहुप्रतीक्षित फिल्म कांतारा ए लीजेंड चैप्टर आज गुरुवार अक्तूबर को दशहरा के अवसर पर रिलीज हो चुकी है। इस बार भी ऋषभ शेट्टी लीड रोल में हैं। दर्शकों को फिल्म पसंद आई है। इसी के साथ उन्हें सरप्राइज भी मिल गया है। फिल्म के तीसरे पार्ट का एलान हो गया है। कांतारा चैप्टर के आखिर में तीसरी फिल्म की पुष्टि हुई है। क्या होगा टाइटल जानिए\n",

            "इस तरह हुआ तीसरे पार्ट का एलान\n",
            "दरअसल फिल्म कांतारा चैप्टर के आखिर में एक बच्चा सवाल करता है। सवाल होता है क्या भगवान इसी कुएं में रहते हैं इस पर एक बुजुर्ग शख्स कहता है इसके लिए एक अलग दंत कथा सुनानी पड़ेगी। इसके बाद कांतारा चैप्टर की अनाउंसमेंट के साथ फिल्म खत्म हो जाती है। मगर जातेजाते दर्शकों को सरप्राइज दे जाती है या कहें कि तीसरी फिल्म का तोहफा दे जाती है।\n",

        "\n",
        "If **Tokenization** is the process of breaking raw text into numerical IDs for the machine, **Detokenization** is the \"reverse engineering\" phase that reconstructs human-readable text from those numbers.\n",
        "\n",

        "Your function performs three critical steps to restore the text:\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  **ID-to-Token Mapping:**\n",
        "    * The machine only knows integers (e.g., `[452, 1109, 23]`).\n",
        "    * We use the **Vocabulary** (dictionary) to map these back to string fragments (e.g., `['Hel', 'lo', 'ĠWorld']`).\n",
        "\n",
        "2.  **The \"Ġ\" (Space Marker) and it's importance:**\n",
        "    * *Why do we see this character?* In algorithms like **BPE (Byte Pair Encoding)**, the tokenizer replaces standard spaces with a special character (often `Ġ`) to preserve whitespace information during the split.\n",
        "    * *The Fix:* The `Ġ` character replacement is the sanitization step. It converts these internal markers back into actual spaces so the text is readable.\n",
        "\n",
        "3.  **Reconstruction:**\n",
        "    * Finally, the fragments are joined to form the complete sentence.\n",

            "Original Text: कभीकभी कोई फिल्म आपको बिल्कुल निशब्द कर देती है। कभी उसका असर इतना गहरा होता है कि शब्द ही नहीं मिलते। कभी आप इतने प्रभावित होते हैं कि उसके बारे में बात करना ही बंद नहीं कर पाते। और कभी वह आपके दिल को इतना छू जाती है कि आप बस उसकी जादुई दुनिया में खो जाते हैं।\n",
            "लेकिन जब कोई फिल्म ये सब एक साथ कर दिखाती है तो वह सिर्फ एक मास्टरपीस नहीं रह जाती वह एक सांस्कृतिक घटना बन जाती है। ऋषभ शेट्टी की कांतारा चैप्टर ठीक ऐसा ही असर छोड़ती है।\n",
            "फिल्म की शुरुआत कदंब वंश और उसके क्रूर शासक से होती है जिसकी लालच हर ज़मीन और पानी को कब्ज़े में लेने की है। चाहे आदमी हो औरत या बच्चा उसके लिए कोई मायने नहीं। वह सबको मारकर अपनी हुकूमत फैलाता है।\n",
            "एक बार ऐसे ही अभियान के दौरान वह समुद्र किनारे मछली पकड़ते एक रहस्यमयी बूढ़े आदमी को देखता है। अपने सैनिकों को उसे पकड़ने का आदेश देता है। जैसे ही वे उसे खींचकर ले जाते हैं उसके थैले से कीमती सामान गिरते हैं।\n",
            "शासक उन चीज़ों को देखता है और उनके स्रोत की खोज में निकल पड़ता है। यह सफ़र उसे कांतारा तक ले जाता है जहां जनजातियां प्रकृति के साथ सामंजस्य में रहती हैं। जब उसकी नज़र ईश्वर पूंधोट्टम पर पड़ती है जो कांतारा की एक पवित्र जगह है और दिव्य शक्ति द्वारा संरक्षित है तभी उसकी महत्वाकांक्षा को असली चुनौती मिलती है।\n",
            "कई सालों बाद कहानी पहुंचती है विजयेंद्र जयाराम तक जो भांगड़ा का राजा है। लंबे शासन के बाद उसका बेटा कुलशेखर गुलशन देवैया राजा बनता है और उसकी बेटी कनकवती रुक्मिणी वसंत कोष की ज़िम्मेदारी संभालती है।\n",
            "दूसरी तरफ कांतारा के नेता बर्मे ऋषभ शेट्टी गांव को विकसित करने और लोगों का जीवन सुधारने की कोशिश करते हैं। जब कांतारा के लोग भांगड़ा पहुंचते हैं तो मामला ज़मीन के मालिकाना हक उसकी रक्षा और उसके विनाश की धमकी पर बड़ा संघर्ष बन जाता है।\n",
            "अगर की कांतारा ने आपकी सांसें रोक दी थीं तो यह प्रीक्वल पहला भाग उस अनुभव को दस गुना बढ़ा देता है। फिल्म जैसे ही कदंब और भांगड़ा वंश और जनजातियों की पृष्ठभूमि वाली आवाज़ से शुरू होती है आप उसकी दुनिया में खो जाते हैं।\n",
            "हर दृश्य बेहद बारीकी से गढ़ा गया है। दमन समानता और शोषण इन सबको फिल्म गहरी संवेदनशीलता से छूती है। जैसे रथ और घोड़े वाला दृश्य जहां कांतारा की जनजाति जिन्हें अछूत माना जाता है उन्हें चलाते हैं। यह दृश्य इतना सहज और दमदार है कि नज़र हटाना मुश्किल हो जाता है।\n",
            "फिल्म का पहला हिस्सा बेहद दमदार है। चाहे रथ और घोड़े का पीछा करने वाला सीन हो या इंटरवल से पहले जंगल की लड़ाई फिल्मनिर्माण अपने शिखर पर दिखता है। ऋषभ शेट्टी ने जिस जुनून और मेहनत से इसे बनाया है वह हर फ्रेम में झलकता है।\n",
            "जब कहानी भांगड़ा राज्य और शराबी कुलशेखर पर आती है तो एक और जनजाति का जिक्र होता है और कहानी और गहरी हो जाती है। यह सिर्फ अमीर बनाम गरीब की लड़ाई नहीं है बल्कि जनजातियों के भीतर भी सत्ता संघर्ष और अच्छाईबुराई की जंग सामने आती है। कांतारा की डरावनी गुलिगा चीख यहां और भी प्रभावी हो जाती है। ऋषभ शेट्टी का बर्मे अलगअलग तरह की चीखों से भावनाएँ प्रकट करता है। ये दृश्य लगातार रोंगटे खड़े कर देने वाले हैं।\n",
            "अगर ऋषभ शेट्टी इस फिल्म का स्तंभ हैं तो रुक्मिणी वसंत कनकवती मजबूत सहारा हैं। उनका किरदार बहुत दमदार है और उन्होंने शानदार अभिनय किया है। जयाराम अपनी अनुभवी अदाकारी से फिल्म को और गहराई देते हैं। गुलशन देवैया का अयोग्य राजा वाला रोल इतना सही बैठता है कि उनकी मौजूदगी ही खलती है और यही उनकी सफलता है।\n",
            "कांतारा चैप्टर की सबसे बड़ी ताकत उसकी परतदार और प्रतीकात्मक कहानी है। यह सोचने पर मजबूर करती है और जब कोई फिल्म ऐसा करती है तो वह दर्शकों को पूरी तरह बांध लेती है। कहानी और अभिनय के अलावा फिल्म तकनीकी स्तर पर भी बेहतरीन है। अरविंद एस कश्यप की सिनेमैटोग्राफी अजनिश लोकनाथ का संगीत और विज़ुअल इफेक्ट्स शानदार हैं।\n",
            "कांतारा की तुलना में प्रीक्वल में और भी बड़े सिनेमाई दृश्य हैं लेकिन यह कहानी पर हावी नहीं होते। हालांकि दूसरे हिस्से में कुछ ग्राफिक्स थोड़े कमजोर लगते हैं पर यह छोटी सी कमी है। फिल्म का क्लाइमैक्स और गुलिगा वाले दृश्य बारबार देखने लायक हैं। ऋषभ शेट्टी इन पलों में वाकई प्रकृति की ताकत जैसे लगते हैं। इतने प्रभावशाली दृश्य और इतनी गहरी कहानी के साथ कांतारा की इस दुनिया से प्यार होना स्वाभाविक है। इसी वजह से कांतारा चैप्टर इस साल की बेहतरीन फिल्मों में गिनी जाएगी।\n",
            "ऋषभ शेट्टी की कांतारा चैप्टर की शुरुआत उस वादे से होती है जो उन्होंने थिएटर के बाहर ही जनता से किया है उनकी में आई फिल्म कांतारा ने दंतकथा पर बेस्ड ऐसा संसार रचा था ऐसी कहानी दिखाई थी जो जनता ने पहले कभी नहीं देखी थी सिनेमा के पर्दे पर नया संसार रचने में ये फिल्म खुद में आइकॉनिक बन चुकी है\n",
            "ऐसे में ऋषभ के सामने चैलेंज ये था कि उन्हें कांतारा चैप्टर में ना सिर्फ पिछला लेवल बरकरार रखना है बल्कि उससे और एक कदम आगे जाना है क्या ऋषभ कामयाब हुए इसके जवाब के लिए हम फिल्म देख रहे हैं और साथसाथ आपको दे रहे हैं ये रिव्यू\n",

            "कांतारा चैप्टर उस रहस्य से शुरू होती है जो पहली फिल्म में अधूरा छूटा था शिवा उसके पिता और उनसे पिछली पीढ़ियों में भूतकोला करने वाले जंगल में उस एक अंधेरी जगह पर ही क्यों गायब होते हैं इस रहस्य का जवाब उस दंतकथा में है जो पिछली फिल्म में केवल छुई गई थी अब आप इस कथा में गहरे उतरते हैं\n",
            "कहानी आपको एक जंगल और राजा के शासन में ले जाती है इस हिस्से में पहले राजा और जंगल में एक दीवार खड़ी होती है मगर आने वाली पीढ़ियों में उस दीवार के पार देखने की जिज्ञासा कहानी को आगे बढ़ाती है\n",
            "फर्स्ट हाफ की शुरुआत में आपको कहानी नैरेट की जा रही है बैकग्राउंड समझाया जा रहा है इस सेटअप में समय लगता है शायद आप कुछ जगहों पर सब्र छोड़ने वाले हों लेकिन तभी ऋषभ अपने नए संसार के पत्ते खोलते हैं वो जंगल के समुदाय के लीडर हैं नाम है बेरमे जंगल का ये संसार जिस तरह रचा गया है उसमें इतनी डिटेल है कि उसे देखते हुए आप ऋषभ की स्टोरीटेलिंग के कायल होते चले जाते हैं\n",

            "टेक्निकली विजुअल्स के लेवल पर स्टोरीटेलिंग में एक नया संसार गढ़ने में ऋषभ की मास्टरी दिख रही है कांतारा चैप्टर का माहौल सेट है विजुअल एक्सपीरिएंस अद्भुत है एक्शन शानदार है वर्ल्डबिल्डिंग रोमांस आपको अरेस्ट करने वाला है अब देखना है कि सेकंड हाफ में क्या जादू होता है\n",

            "अब कहानी जो ट्विस्ट लेती है उसकी कल्पना भी आप पहले से नहीं कर पाते फिल्म की राइटिंग टीम को सलाम बनता है इस विजुअली अद्भुत संसार जादुई म्यूजिक स्कोर और सिनेमाई तकनीक के साथ उन्होंने जो ट्विस्ट कहानी को दिया है वो किसी बेहतरीन थ्रिलर जैसा है\n",

            "सेकंड हाफ जिस हाई नोट पर उमड़तेघुमड़ते इमोशंस वाले मोड़ से शुरू हुआ उसमें मुझे ये चिंता थी कि कहीं क्लाइमेक्स की तरफ फिल्म की एनर्जी डाउन ना होने लगे मगर ऋषभ ने पूरे सेकंड हाफ में एनर्जी को जहां पहुंचाया है वो इंडियन सिनेमा में याद रखा जाएगा\n",
            "क्लाइमेक्स के महत्वपूर्ण सीक्वेंस में कांतारा चैप्टर माइथोलॉजी की जिस साइड है वहां ऋषभ को एक जगह पूरी तरह ग्राफिक्स से तैयार एक कैरेक्टर पर जाना पड़ा इससे उस सीक्वेंस का फील अभी तक रियल नजर आ रहे विजुअल्स से अलग तो होता है मगर ये पूरी तरह ऋषभ की कहानी का विजुअल व्याकरण है जो तब भी आपको कहानी में बांधे रखता है\n",
            "क्लाइमेक्स फिल्म को उससे भी हाई नोट पर ले जाता है जहां से सेकंड हाफ शुरू हुआ था कांतारा चैप्टर एक और फ़िल्म के वादे के साथ खत्म होती है मगर ऋषभ का रचा संसार उनकी फिल्ममेकिंग और उनका शानदार काम आपके साथ रहता है क्लाइमेक्स की तरफ ये फिल्म एक जगह सिनेमा से ऊपर उठ जाती है और कुछ ऐसा महसूस करवाती है जो कहा नहीं जा सकता\n",

वादे से होती है जो उन्होंने थिएटर के बाहर ही जनता से किया है उनकी में आई फिल्म कांतारा ने दंतकथा पर बेस्ड ऐसा संसार रचा था ऐसी कहानी दिखाई थी जो जनता ने पहले कभी नहीं देखी थी सिनेमा के पर्दे पर नया संसार रचने में ये फिल्म खुद में आइकॉनिक बन चुकी है\\nऐसे में ऋषभ के सामने चैलेंज ये था कि उन्हें कांतारा चैप्टर में ना सिर्फ पिछला लेवल बरकरार रखना है बल्कि उससे और एक कदम आगे जाना है क्या ऋषभ कामयाब हुए इसके जवाब के लिए हम फिल्म देख रहे हैं और साथसाथ आपको दे रहे हैं ये रिव्यू\\nकहां से शुरू होती है कहानी\\nकांतारा चैप्टर उस रहस्य से शुरू होती है जो पहली फिल्म में अधूरा छूटा था शिवा उसके पिता और उनसे पिछली पीढ़ियों में भूतकोला करने वाले जंगल में उस एक अंधेरी जगह पर ही क्यों गायब होते हैं इस रहस्य का जवाब उस दंतकथा में है जो पिछली फिल्म में केवल छुई गई थी अब आप इस कथा में गहरे उतरते हैं\\nकहानी आपको एक जंगल और राजा के शासन में ले जाती है इस हिस्से में पहले राजा और जंगल में एक दीवार खड़ी होती है मगर आने वाली पीढ़ियों में उस दीवार के पार देखने की जिज्ञासा कहानी को आगे बढ़ाती है\\nफर्स्ट हाफ की शुरुआत में आपको कहानी नैरेट की जा रही है बैकग्राउंड समझाया जा रहा है इस सेटअप में समय लगता है शायद आप कुछ जगहों पर सब्र छोड़ने वाले हों लेकिन तभी ऋषभ अपने नए संसार के पत्ते खोलते हैं वो जंगल के समुदाय के लीडर हैं नाम है बेरमे जंगल का ये संसार जिस तरह रचा गया है उसमें इतनी डिटेल है कि उसे देखते हुए आप ऋषभ की स्टोरीटेलिंग के कायल होते चले जाते हैं\\nराजकुमारी कनकवती की एंट्री होती है किरदार निभा रहीं रुक्मिणी वसंत पहले फ्रेम से अटेंशन बांध लेती हैं बेरमे और कनकवती की केमिस्ट्री सबसे बेहतरीन लव स्टोरीज को टक्कर देती है फिर आता है कहानी का कनफ्लिक्ट जो इंटरवल ब्लॉक में समेटा गया है जहां शुरुआत में आप फिल्म के थोड़ा ज्यादा बोलने से सब्र खोने वाले थे वहीं इस ब्लॉक में एक शब्द नहीं बोला गया है सबकुछ स्क्रीन पर घट रहा है विजुअल्स में इमोशन है भाव हैं और प्रतीक हैं\\nटेक्निकली विजुअल्स के लेवल पर स्टोरीटेलिंग में एक नया संसार गढ़ने में ऋषभ की मास्टरी दिख रही है कांतारा चैप्टर का माहौल सेट है विजुअल एक्सपीरिएंस अद्भुत है एक्शन शानदार है वर्ल्डबिल्डिंग रोमांस आपको अरेस्ट करने वाला है अब देखना है कि सेकंड हाफ में क्या जादू होता है\\nकांतारा चैप्टर का सेकंड हाफ इसकी जान है फर्स्ट हाफ खत्म होतेहोते फिल्म जहां तक पहुंची थी वो जैसे एक दरवाजा था जो आगे के लिए खोला गया था सेकंड हाफ शुरू होते ही आप जहां कदम रखते हैं वहां पूरी फिल्म का रहस्य है जंगल के मिथक यहां खुल रहे हैं माइथोलॉजिकल शक्तियां अब अपने खेल के चरम पर हैं\\nअब कहानी जो ट्विस्ट लेती है उसकी कल्पना भी आप पहले से नहीं कर पाते फिल्म की राइटिंग टीम को सलाम बनता है इस विजुअली अद्भुत संसार जादुई म्यूजिक स्कोर और सिनेमाई तकनीक के साथ उन्होंने जो ट्विस्ट कहानी को दिया है वो किसी बेहतरीन थ्रिलर जैसा है\\nधमाकेदार है क्लाइमेक्स\\nसेकंड हाफ जिस हाई नोट पर उमड़तेघुमड़ते इमोशंस वाले मोड़ से शुरू हुआ उसमें मुझे ये चिंता थी कि कहीं क्लाइमेक्स की तरफ फिल्म की एनर्जी डाउन ना होने लगे मगर ऋषभ ने पूरे सेकंड हाफ में एनर्जी को जहां पहुंचाया है वो इंडियन सिनेमा में याद रखा जाएगा\\nक्लाइमेक्स के महत्वपूर्ण सीक्वेंस में कांतारा चैप्टर माइथोलॉजी की जिस साइड है वहां ऋषभ को एक जगह पूरी तरह ग्राफिक्स से तैयार एक कैरेक्टर पर जाना पड़ा इससे उस सीक्वेंस का फील अभी तक रियल नजर आ रहे विजुअल्स से अलग तो होता है मगर ये पूरी तरह ऋषभ की कहानी का विजुअल व्याकरण है जो तब भी आपको कहानी में बांधे रखता है\\nक्लाइमेक्स फिल्म को उससे भी हाई नोट पर ले जाता है जहां से सेकंड हाफ शुरू हुआ था कांतारा चैप्टर एक और फ़िल्म के वादे के साथ खत्म होती है मगर ऋषभ का रचा संसार उनकी फिल्ममेकिंग और उनका शानदार काम आपके साथ रहता है क्लाइमेक्स की तरफ
